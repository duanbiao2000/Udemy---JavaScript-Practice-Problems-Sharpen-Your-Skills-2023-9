<p><strong>Code Files</strong></p><p>Since the purpose of this course is for you to practice your JavaScript skills, you will spend a great deal of time doing actual coding exercises. Every introduction and solution topic comes with the same downloadable files. One folder consists of a set of starting files and the second folder contains the ending files. Use the starting files to begin the exercise and work to solve the problem. The ending files can be used to review the solution as needed.</p><p>You can download files for each topic that contains them using the resources link for that topic. Of if you would like, you can download all the files at once from our GitHub repository. </p><p>To download the files from our GitHub repository go to:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/allthingsjavascript/practice_problems.git" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/allthingsjavascript/practice_problems</a></p><p>To download a zip, you can click on the green code button and select Download ZIP.</p><p><strong>Using the Console and Node</strong></p><p>In this course I&nbsp;use Visual Studio Code as my code editor. To present solutions I&nbsp;will make use of the console in a browser and/or Node from within Visual Studio Code. You can access the JavaScript console in Chrome by pressing Command + Option + J on a Mac or Control + Shift + J on Windows or Linux. You can access the command prompt for testing in Node by pressing Ctrl + ` or Ctrl + ~. You must have previously installed Node in order to view results in Node. For more information you can visit <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial</a>.</p><p>If you are using a browser other than Chrome, use the commands indicated below to access the console:</p><ul><li><p>Firefox:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Windows: Ctrl + Shift + K</p></li><li><p>Mac: Cmd + Opt + K</p></li></ul></li><li><p>IE &amp; Edge</p><ul><li><p>F12 and then click on the Console tab</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Safari (You must first enable the Show Develop menu)</p><ul><li><p>Cmd + Opt + C</p></li></ul></li></ul>
